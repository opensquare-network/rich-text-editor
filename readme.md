## Demo

`yarn dev`

## Development
Basically we test out everything in `demo/index.tsx` and
migrate changes to `src/index.tsx`

## Controllers & Commands

The v12 version of react-mde represents us a head-less lib, 
which gives us full control of everything, but we need to 
compose all into a component ourselves.

## Styling

we want to figure out a nice clean way to do styings.
